# README

This is an example app to go with an article about using a `has_many through` association
in a form using Rails 4.

To get started, clone this repo and then run `bin/setup`. This installs
everything you need and then you can fire up a server `rails s` and view
the results in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
